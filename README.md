**Heart Disease Dataset Analysis**

The directory contains 4 databases concerning heart disease diagnosis. All attributes are numeric-valued. This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.  In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0). The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

**Why I selected the dataset?**

I am interested in the medical field and health science domain. Lot of relevant patient and health care data have been collected over the years across the world. Machine learning algorithms have lot of scope in this domain to be able to analyze and answer health care related questions. Detecting patterns using these datasets would give an upper hand to the health care practices to better provide services to the world, early detection of diseases and common health symptoms, aid in the diagnosis of illness based on already available data and so on. This aspect excites me as a software engineer where I can contribute to the betterment of health care by applying machine learning paradigms.
The heart is an extremely complex organ with a challenging role to play in keeping us alive. Heart disease accounts for nearly 630,000 deaths in the United States of America every year. It is so frequent that every 40 seconds at least one person will have heart attack and every minute at least one person dies out of heart failure conditions. This dataset contains some medical information of patients which helps in determine the presence of heart disease in a person which could help an individual in getting medical diagnosis at the early stage.

**3 well-formulated research questions that could be answered by exploring the dataset.**

1.	How has gender and age affected the patterns of heart disease occurrence in patient for the past few years?
2.	What are the most effective factors in determining the presence of heart diseases in a patient?
3.	How much physical activity needs to be stimulated in the patients to detect the heart disease in patients?
